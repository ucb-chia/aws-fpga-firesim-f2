# AWS AFI Manifest File Specification

An AFI submission to AWS using `aws ec2 create-fpga-image` includes a pointer to an S3 bucket with a tar file containing the encrypted FPGA Design Checkpoint (DCP) and a mandatory `manifest.txt` file.

This document is a purely informative specification for the `manifest.txt` file formatted with key=value pairs. Developers should never manually modify the manifest as it's automatically created by the AWS build scripts.
