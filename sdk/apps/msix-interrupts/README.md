# MSI-X Interrupts Implementation Guide
This guide describes how to implement PCIe Message Signaled Interrupts Extended (MSI-X) with F2. It demonstrates the implementation of a custom interrupt service routine (ISR) and provides working examples of both kernel and user space code.

## Key Concepts
* F2 Shell uses MSI-X protocol to support up to 16 user-defined interrupts
* Each interrupt can trigger a unique ISR or share an ISR with parameters
* ISRs execute in kernel space, where errors can cause system instability

## Implementation Steps
* [PCIe Configuration Space Setup](#enabling-interrupts-in-pcie-configuration-space)
* [Kernel Interrupt Registration](#registering-interrupts-with-the-kernel)
* [PCIe DMA Subsystem Configuration](#configuring-interrupts-in-the-pcie-dma-subsystem).

### Enabling Interrupts in PCIe Configuration Space
MSI-X functionality is enabled using the ```pci_enable_msix_exact``` function which requires the following:
* Pointer to the device's PCI data structure 
* Table to map kernel vector numbers to device interrupts
* Number of interrupts that are being allocated in the kernel

This code runs during kernel module insertion when the driver is loaded.

```
#define NUM_OF_USER_INTS 16
struct msix_entry f2_ints[] = {
  {.vector = 0, .entry = 0},
  {.vector = 0, .entry = 1},
  ...
  {.vector = 0, .entry = 15}
};
# f2_dev is a pointer to the PCI device structure, representing your device
pci_enable_msix_exact(f2_dev, f2_ints, NUM_OF_USER_INTS);
```

### Registering Interrupts with the Kernel
Once interrupts are allocated in the kernel, the kernel function ```request_irq``` is needed to connect each interrupt vector to a specific ISR. In this example all 16 interrupt sources point to the same ISR, ```f2_isr```. To differentiate between the interrupt sources, a unique structure (a pointer to an integer) is registered with the vector. The ISR retrieves this structure when it is called. This code also runs during kernel module insertion, immediately after enabling MSI-X.

```
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_OF_USER_INTS; i++) {
  f2_dev_id[i] = kmalloc(sizeof(int), GFP_DMA | GFP_USER);
  *f2_dev_id[i] = i;
  status =
      request_irq(f2_ints[i].vector, f2_isr, 0, "F2 Driver", f2_dev_id[i]);
}
```

### Configuring Interrupts in the PCIe DMA Subsystem
The snippet of code shown below runs from user space and programs the PCIe block to handle interrupts. This code is executed during application runtime, typically when initializing the device for use.

Each MSI-X entry needs its interrupt vector number programmed in the IRQ block. By default, all vectors point to index 0. For this example, each user interrupt is programmed to point to a different interrupt vector to illustrate using all 16 entries. The vector numbers are aligned on byte boundaries, and four 32-bit addresses (0x80-0x8f) are used to assign interrupt vectors.

```
rc |= fpga_pci_poke(dma_bar_handle, dma_reg_addr(IRQ_TGT, 0, 0x080), 0x03020100);    
rc |= fpga_pci_poke(dma_bar_handle, dma_reg_addr(IRQ_TGT, 0, 0x084), 0x07060504);    
rc |= fpga_pci_poke(dma_bar_handle, dma_reg_addr(IRQ_TGT, 0, 0x088), 0x0b0a0908);
rc |= fpga_pci_poke(dma_bar_handle, dma_reg_addr(IRQ_TGT, 0, 0x08c), 0x0f0e0d0c);
```

The final step is to enable interrupts by writing the interrupt enable mask bits. In the example, all the interrupts are enabled at once with a single write of 0xffff to the IRQ Block User Interrupt Enable Mask register (0x004).

```
rc = fpga_pci_poke(dma_bar_handle, dma_reg_addr(IRQ_TGT, 0, 0x004), 0xffff);
```

## Generating Interrupts
The CL_DRAM_HBM_DMA example design does not generate interrupts independently. It instead contains a register which when written will produce one or more interrupts. The test program writes this register to generate interrupts. When the interrupt is received by the ISR, it will read a DDR location in CL and increment it by one. The test program monitors the interrupt status register in the CL and and waits for the acknowledge bit to be asserted.

### Instructions to run example
```
git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git
cd aws-fpga
source sdk_setup.sh
```

Note:
* Replace `<slot_number>` with the appropriate FPGA slot number you're using
* To find the `<bus:device.function>` of your FPGA slot, use `sudo fpga-describe-local-image -S <slot_number>`

Use the `fpga-load-local-image` command to load the FPGA with the pre-generated CL_DRAM_HBM_DMA AFI
```
sudo fpga-load-local-image -S <slot_number> -I agfi-01d87c1ef9313165b
```

Run the following command with the verbose flag to see if interrupts are enabled
```
sudo lspci -v -s <bus:device.function>
```
Notice that the Capabilities Register [60] indicates that MSI-X functionality is currently disabled (shown by the 'Enable-' status)
```
<bus:device.function> Memory controller: Amazon.com, Inc. Device f001
        Subsystem: Device fedc:1d51
        Physical Slot: 3-1
        Flags: fast devsel, NUMA node 0
        Memory at 5004c000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
        Memory at 50048100000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=64K]
        Memory at 52000000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=128G]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3
        Capabilities: [60] MSI-X: Enable- Count=33 Masked-
        Capabilities: [70] Express Endpoint, MSI 00
```

Next, navigate to the `aws-fpga/sdk/apps/msix-interrupts` directory and run the following commands
```
make                             # compiles the kernel module
make test                        # compiles the test program
make install SLOT=<slot_number>  # install the device driver
```

To check to see if the driver loaded, run:
```
sudo dmesg
```

This command will print the message buffer from the kernel. Since the device driver is a kernel module, special prints are used to place messages in this buffer.

Rerun `sudo lspci -v -s <bus:device.function>` and you should see that MSI-X was enabled by the driver.

```
<bus:device.function> Memory controller: Amazon.com, Inc. Device f001
        Subsystem: Device fedc:1d51
        Physical Slot: 3-1
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, NUMA node 0
        Memory at 5004c000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
        Memory at 50048100000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=64K]
        Memory at 52000000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=128G]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3
        Capabilities: [60] MSI-X: Enable+ Count=33 Masked-
        Capabilities: [70] Express Endpoint, MSI 00
```

To see the interrupts in use, run the following command
```
sudo ./f2_test <slot_number>
```
Running the example on a 12xlarge instance will show the following on the terminal:
```
Starting MSI-X Interrupt test 
Initial DDR value: 0
IRQ Block Identifier read_data: 1fc20006
IRQ Block User Interrupt Enable Mask read_data: 0, Addr: 2004
IRQ Block User Vector Number read_data: 3020100, Addr: 2080

Triggering single interrupt (interrupt 0)...
Initial DDR value: 0
Current DDR value: 1

Triggering each of the MSI-X interrupts...
Triggering interrupt 0 (bit 0)
Triggering interrupt 1 (bit 1)
...
Triggering interrupt 15 (bit 15)
CL interrupt status read_data: ffff0000
CL read_data: 00000000
```
Run `sudo dmesg` to see the kernel log which shows each interrupt that is triggered and its corresponding DDR counter value. 
 
### Other Useful MakeFile Targets
` make remove `
* Removes the F2 kernel module from the system using `rmmod`
* Use this command when you want to unload the driver

` make clean ` 
* Removes all compiled files and build artifacts
* Cleans the kernel module build directory
* Removes the compiled test program (f2_test)
* Use this before rebuilding the driver from scratch
