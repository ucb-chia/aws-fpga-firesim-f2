AWS AFI Manifest File Specification
===================================

An AFI submission to AWS using ``aws ec2 create-fpga-image`` includes a
pointer to an S3 bucket with a tar file containing the encrypted FPGA
Design Checkpoint (DCP) and a mandatory ``manifest.txt`` file.

This document is a purely informative specification for the
``manifest.txt`` file formatted with key=value pairs. Developers should
never manually modify the manifest as it’s automatically created by the
AWS build scripts.
